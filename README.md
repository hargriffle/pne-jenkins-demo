# Jenkins Demo 

This repo has a demo app that sends an SMS message whenever the source
code is updated on github.  

The idea is to demonstrate a very simple connection between Jenkins
and github.

If you contribute to this for the sake of a demo you should be aware
that your mobile number may linger around in the source code.

If you fork this and you want it to work then you have to make sure that 
your shell is exporting the following variables

* `TWILIO_ACCOUNT`: your Twilio account id
* `TWILIO_TOKEN`: your Twilio token


Enjoy
